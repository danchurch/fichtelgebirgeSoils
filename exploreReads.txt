## now, much of this analysis will likely have to be done in R,
## on a computer with sufficient memory.

## the goal would be to contain this analysis to R
## so we'll use dada2 in R

## for the moment, let's use the lab computer,

## with a specialized environment for dada2.
## I remember R with conda package management being kind of 
## a pain

## this looks like a good guide for R with conda:
https://saturncloud.io/blog/installing-conda-for-r-a-guide-for-data-scientists/

conda activate 

conda create -n dada2 -c r r-base

## to old
conda remove -n dada2 --all

## can we force a newer version?

conda create -n dada2 -c r r-base>=4.3.0

conda update -n base -c defaults conda

conda activate dada2

## theoretically, we can install this way:
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-dada2
## fails
## try internal installations:

install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("dada2")

## that takes forever.
